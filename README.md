## Features (production-ready)
- **Core Graph Operations**: Node/Edge CRUD, graph traversal, path finding
- **Advanced Graph Algorithms**: BFS, Dijkstra's shortest path, PageRank centrality
- **Graph Analysis Tools**: Connectivity analysis, diameter calculation, path finding, density metrics
- **Enhanced I/O Module**: Static memory, inline functions, UTF-8 support, colored terminal output
- **WAL with header/version**: CRC per entry, and segment rotation
- **Tail scan and auto-truncate**: Trailing/partial or corrupt bytes
- **Atomic snapshots**: Temp â†’ fsync â†’ rename â†’ dir fsync, length + CRC
- **Snapshot .bak fallback**: On restore
- **LSN-aware recovery**: Restore snapshot, then replay WAL after LSN
- **Strict durability**: Fsync + F_FULLFSYNC on macOS where possible
- **Single-writer safety**: Lock file next to WAL
- **Static memory pools**: Nodes/edges/embeddings; lock-free reads, mutex-guarded writes
- **CLI**: Init/status/snapshot/restore/check/compact with enhanced output
- **Health reporting**: WAL health exposed via CLI and API

## Quick install (prebuilt)
Prebuilt binaries are published on GitHub Releases (Linux x86_64, macOS universal, Windows x86_64).

If no release has been tagged yet, skip to [Build from source](#build-from-source).

### One-line (Linux/macOS)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nen-Co/nendb/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
# Then:
nendb --help
```
This script:
- Detects OS/arch
- Downloads latest release asset + SHA256SUMS
- Verifies checksum
- Places `nen` into `$HOME/.local/bin` (creates if missing)

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Replace VERSION after first release (placeholder using latest tag API):
$uri = Invoke-RestMethod https://api.github.com/repos/Nen-Co/nendb/releases/latest; \
$asset = ($uri.assets | Where-Object { $_.name -like 'nendb-windows-x86_64.zip' }).browser_download_url; \
Invoke-WebRequest $asset -OutFile nendb.zip; Expand-Archive nendb.zip -DestinationPath .; \
Move-Item nendb-windows-x86_64.exe nendb.exe; Write-Host 'Run: ./nendb --help'
```

### Manual download
1. Visit: https://github.com/Nen-Co/nendb/releases
2. Download archive: `nendb-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, `nendb-macos-universal.tar.gz`, or `nendb-windows-x86_64.zip`
3. Verify checksum (compare against `SHA256SUMS`):
   ```bash
   sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS | grep nendb-linux-x86_64
   ```
4. Put `nendb` on your PATH.

(If the latest release isnâ€™t tagged yet, build from source below.)

## Build from source
```bash
# Build and run demo (copy-paste)
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe && \
    ./zig-out/bin/nendb demo
```

Try basic operations:

```bash
# Check help
./zig-out/bin/nendb --help

# Run demo
./zig-out/bin/nendb demo
```

## Common ops (anytime):
```bash
# Graph operations demo
./zig-out/bin/nendb demo

# Run algorithms demo
zig build demo

# Basic help
./zig-out/bin/nendb --help

# TODO: Add more operations as implemented
# ./zig-out/bin/nendb snapshot ./data
# ./zig-out/bin/nendb restore ./data
# ./zig-out/bin/nendb check ./data
# ./zig-out/bin/nendb compact ./data
# ./zig-out/bin/nendb force-unlock ./data
```

Optional server mode (TODO):
```bash
./zig-out/bin/nendb serve  # listens on :5454
```

Quick try without a full build:
```bash
zig run src/main.zig -- demo
```

Add build output to PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$PWD/zig-out/bin:$PATH"  # zsh/bash
```

## Install (optional)
User install (no sudo):
```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe install-user
```
System install:
```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe install-system  # may need: sudo zig build ...
```

## Configuration
- Compile-time (see `nendb/src/constants.zig`):
  - memory.node_pool_size, edge_pool_size, embedding_pool_size
  - storage.wal_segment_size, storage.snapshot_interval
- Environment overrides:
  - NENDB_SYNC_EVERY (batch fsync interval)
  - NENDB_SEGMENT_SIZE (bytes)

## Durability details
- Appends are O(1) using in-memory tail; correctness from tail-scan on open/rotate
- Rotation fsyncs file and directory before/after rename; header written and fsynced on new active WAL
- Snapshot is atomic (temp file â†’ fsync â†’ rename â†’ dir fsync); then WAL is truncated to header
- Restore prefers `nendb.snapshot`; on CRC/length failure, falls back to `.bak`; then replays WAL after LSN
- On any CRC mismatch during replay (segments or active), truncates to last good boundary

## Health and operations
- Single-writer lock: `<path>/nendb.wal.lock`
- `wal_health` includes healthy flag, io_error_count, last_error, end_pos, segment stats
- Use `status --fail-on-unhealthy` for automation / monitoring hooks

## Limitations and expectations
- Single-writer process model (readers are lock-free)
- No replication yet; rely on snapshots + external backup
- Concurrency: writes serialized by mutex
- Memory sizes fixed at start (static pools)

## Tests
```bash
zig build test
```
Includes tests for WAL persistence, rotation/replay, tail truncation recovery, snapshot .bak fallback, and single-writer lock.

## Architecture
High-level design, lifecycle, and recovery flow: see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
