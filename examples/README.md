## Contributing Examples

When adding new examples:

1. Follow the TDD workflow: Write tests first
2. Use NenStyle coding standards (static memory, zero allocation in hot paths)
3. Include performance benchmarks
4. Document any external dependencies
5. Provide clear usage instructions

## Example Structure

Each example should include:
- Main example code
- Unit tests
- Performance tests
- README with usage instructions
- Sample data (if applicable)
